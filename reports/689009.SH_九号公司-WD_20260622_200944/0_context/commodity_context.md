## Analyst Instructions
- Treat Tushare futures data as a proxy only when it matches the company's main product or key input.
- Treat whitelist web pages as evidence snippets unless an exact price/date/unit is parsed and shown.
- Do not state R32, R125, lithium, copper, gold, inventory, or spread changes as facts unless they appear in the evidence table.
- If the product has no reliable data source, list it as an unverified key variable instead of inventing a price change.
- If a thesis-critical input is marked missing, treat it as neutral for direction and only as a confidence cap; it cannot prove margin deterioration or margin resilience by itself.
